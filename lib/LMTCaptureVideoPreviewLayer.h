 @class LMTCaptureVideoPreviewLayer
 @abstract
 A CoreAnimation layer subclass for previewing the visual output of an AVCaptureSession.
 
 @discussion
 An AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer instance is a subclass of CALayer and is therefore
 suitable for insertion in a layer hierarchy as part of a graphical interface.
 One creates an AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer instance with the capture session to be
 previewed, using +layerWithSession: or -initWithSession:.  Using the @"videoGravity"
 property, one can influence how content is viewed relative to the layer bounds.  On
 some hardware configurations, the orientation of the layer can be manipulated using
 @"orientation" and @"mirrored".
